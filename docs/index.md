Indroduction
------------

MDSplus is a set of software tools for data acquisition and storage and a methodology for management of complex scientific data.
MDSplus allows all data from an experiment or simulation code to be stored into a single, self-descriptive, hierarchical structure. The system was designed to enable users to easily construct complete and coherent data sets.
The MDSplus programming interface contains only a few basic commands, simplifyng data access even into complex structures. Using the client/server model, data at remote sites can be read or written without file transfers. MDSplus includes x-windows and java tools for viewing data or for modifying or viewing the underlying structures.
Developed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Fusion Research Group in Padua, Italy (Istituto Gas Ionizzati and Consorzio RFX), and the Los Alamos National Lab, MDSplus is the most widely used system for data management in the magnetic fusion energy program. It is currently installed at over 30 sites spread over 4 continents.
The MDSplus developers hope that MDSplus may prove to be a valuable tool for research at your site.
