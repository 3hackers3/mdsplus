MDSObjects  {#lib_mdsobjects}
==========


MDSplus provides API's (application programming interface) to several object 
oriented languages. A common set of classes and methods are provided in all 
of these API's. 

There may be some language specific "enhancements" to the common interface to 
take advantage of some features of the language which are not available in all 
of the languages supported.
